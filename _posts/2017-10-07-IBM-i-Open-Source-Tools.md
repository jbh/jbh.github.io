### Introduction

In the past, IBM i Open Source Tools were installed via a complex process of installing packages from
[Perzl](http://www.perzl.org/aix/). I have described how to do this in past posts such as
[BASH on IBM i](/BASH-on-IBM-i). While this was helpful in the past, it wasn't officially supported by IBM.
There is a new product from IBM that now supports Open Source Technologies and can be installed on the IBM i.


### 5733-OPS

5733-OPS brings many open source tools to the IBM i, and helps create a development environment that is familiar
to a unix or linux developer. Tools such as BASH, rsync, curl, git, python, and much more. See the
[Open Source Technologies](http://p.jbh.io/d) details page for more information on what is included with
each option.

#### How to Install 5733-OPS

[Kevin Adler](http://p.jbh.io/g) has written a great [article](http://p.jbh.io/e) that explains exactly how to obtain
5733-OPS.
