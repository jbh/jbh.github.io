<p>
    Do you need help with full-stack web development and open source technologies on the IBM i? Maybe you need help on
    another platform? My focus is with the IBM i, but I have worked on LAMP systems and Windows Server. With experience
    in command line scripting, full-stack PHP and Node.js web development, REST API development for DB2, Angular, Git
    version control, and much more, I can help find a solution to that issue that has been bugging the web development
    team for awhile.
</p>

<p>
    Whether it's a web development issue, command line automation, or even if your development environment and process
    need more structure, I can provide the solution and training necessary. Please contact me below with any questions.
